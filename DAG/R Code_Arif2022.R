# First, a model to determine the effect of sharks on rays: 

M1 <- glm(Rays~Sharks, data=sharkdata)

summary(M1) # provides point estimate and standard error for sharks, which is -0.1 + 0.003SE

# Next, a model to determine the effect of rays on bivalves: 

M2 <- glm(Bivalves~Rays+Sharks, data=sharkdata)

summary(M2) # provides point estimate and standard error for rays, which is -0.2 + 0.003SE

# The product of the effect of sharks on rays and the effect of rays on bivalves gives the estimate of sharks on bivalves. In our case this is -0.1 x -0.2 = 0.02
